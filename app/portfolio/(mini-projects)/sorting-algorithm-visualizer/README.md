# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 

## Introduction 

## Implementation Details 

## Development Struggles 

## Development Notes 

- [] Settings Panel
  - [] Randomise Array 
  - [] Select Sort Type 
    - [] Select Sort Attributes (i.e. partition type in QuickSort)
  - [] Animation Speed
  - [] Set Array Size
  - [] Show Benchmark Mode
  - [] Step??? (This will be difficult to implement)
  - [] Start Sorting

- [] Benchmark mode 
  - [] Give it a console like feel 
  - [] When you run the algorithms it shows like it would on a CLI 
  - [] Maybe allow console input 
  - [] Have the arrays be extremely large 
  - [] Show live updates (loading state as each element runs its algorithm)

- [] UI 
  - Visualise when indexes are being swaped and are the target of the current sortMethod 
  - 

- [] Bugs 
  - [] Fix issue where it is allowed to play when already running  

- [] Tests
