## Notes for Development 

[x] Settings Panel Options 
  [x] Warpzone - Enable/Disable 
  [x] Population Density - Number Input 1% - 100%
  [x] Refresh interval - 30ms - 1000ms  
  [x] Top Bar Select 
    [x] Evolution Count 
    [x] Population Density 
    [x] Number of Alive cells  
    [x] Alive Cell Percentage 
    [x] Algorithm Duration 

## Future features

[] Enable colour changes for the cells that have been alive the longest. 
[] Add Range Input for Speed of the evolutions  
[] Add UI Change Features
[] Add an indepth coverage of the processes taken  
[] Utilize the Hashlife algorithm 
[] Utilize a Canvas 
[] Add options to switch between algorithms 
[] Add options to switch between display types 
  [] Div grid 
  [] Canvas 
[] Maybe refactor certain classes into a hook? 
[] Add close button to the settings panel 

## Fixes needed 

[] Work on mobile UI 
[] When settings panel is open disable all other buttons
[] Think about the validation for the NumberInput component
[] Refactor SettingsPanel and GameOfLifeDriver to be more succinct
