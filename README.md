# My Portfolio 

This is the code for my Development Portfolio as such it is constantly expanding and I am iterating upon what existed prior. 

The design/ brand footprint is heavily influenced by Britanny Chiangs development portfolio. However, it is worth disclaiming that I have not copied any code from her repository. You can her repository here. 

If you wish to fork this repo and use the code within for you own purpose I would ask that you attribute me in your site, unless the fork is simply to copy the design in which case please attribute Brittany Chiang.

This code base is not meant to act as a template thus if you should want to use it for that I recomnmend that you understand the basics of Next.js 13/ React and TypeScript.
